      <p>
        Accountability for Content: The content of this website has been created with great care. However, no
        guarantee is provided regarding its accuracy, completeness, or timeliness. As per § 7 Para. 1 of the
        German Telemedia Act (DDG), service providers are responsible for their own content on this website.
        However, §§ 8-10 DDG state that service providers are not obligated to monitor third-party information
        or investigate potential illegal activity. Liability is only possible from the moment a specific legal
        violation becomes known. Upon notification of such violations, the content will be removed promptly.

      <h3 class="section-headline">Accountability for Links</h3>
      <p>
        This website may include links to external third-party websites over which we have no control.
        Therefore, we assume no liability for such content. Responsibility lies solely with the respective
        provider or operator. Linked pages were checked for legal violations at the time of linking, and no
        illegal content was identified. Continuous monitoring of linked pages without concrete evidence of
        violations is unreasonable. Upon notification of any legal violations, such links will be removed
        promptly.
